Studies and testings.

## How to use

## Unit testing

Unit testing is a level of software testing where individual units/components of a software are tested. In the React world this means:

- testing an individual React Component;
- or pure functions;

## Integration testing

Integration tests test the interactions between the various components of an application. For a React application, this means testing:

- interactions between React components, typically performed via calling prop functions;
- manipulation of component state;
- direct manipulation of the DOM in React lifecycle methods;

## End-to-end testing

End-to-end testing  to confirm that the entire range of features works from the user’s perspective.
